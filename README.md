Loan Defaults Prediction

• Conducted data cleansing, feature engineering, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the 30,000+ loan status data points

• Trained and compared KNN, Neural Network, Random Forest, and XGBoost models in R to predict loan status

• Identified common patterns of anomalies by using isolation forest and global model interpretation

• Generated confusion matrices and calculated accuracy, AUC, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the models

• Provided recommendations to the financial institution based on analysis results to decrease loan defaults

• Summarized the analytical results and completed two analytical reports for technical and non-technical audiences, respectively
